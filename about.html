<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Some of the Basics</h2>
<p>
    My name is Michael Hebert, and I am pursuing my <strong>bachelor's in Computer Science at Louisiana Tech University.</strong>
    Computer science is where I find myself the most comfortable. Having spent 2 years previously in
    Electrical Engineering, I fell in love with programming and decided to make the switch.
    I enjoy nothing more than learning new programming techniques and trying my hardest to complete every project I begin.
    I would say that learning how to code something that makes life easier is one of my favorite things to do.
    I also have a love for 3D printing, and a lot of my downtime goes into finding practical parts or things to display
    in my room.

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>
    So far in my foray into programming, there have been several classes that have stuck out:
    <ul>
    <li>
        Data Structures: In this class I learned how to program almost every important data structure from the ground
        up in Java. These included linked lists, queues, stacks, and hash tables to name the big ones. I also got to learn
        about time complexity and sorting algorithms. Knowing that whatever I use in my program has an effect on either
        the space it takes up or the time it takes to complete was really eye-opening for me.
    </li>
    <li>
        Systems Programming and Operating Systems: These two classes allowed me to see the inner workings of computers.
        We learned about UNIX and terminal in Systems Programming and mainly threads, semaphores, and memory management
        in OS. The most important takeaway from these two classes was learning C as well as UNIX system operations.
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>3D Printing</h2>
<p>
    Since I am generally indisposed at home with spare time, 3D printing is something that I have fallen in love with
    due to the more set and forget nature of it. I think that this hobby is one of the best things I could have discovered
    because it combines my love for technology with the (almost) instant gratification of getting to hold a physical
    object in your hand that you, or somebody else, designed. These objects can be practical in nature or completely
    decorative, which is what I mostly stick to. I love this hobby so much, in fact, that I even plan to make a page on
    this website dedicated to hosting STL files that I have made. Also, if you haven't noticed, my Prusa Mk3 is the
    background image!
