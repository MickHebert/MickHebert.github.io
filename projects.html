    <!-- PASSWORD MANAGER -->
    <h2>Password Manager</h2>
    <p>
    A very primitive password manager that generates a random string for the user to use as a password.
    Currently only saves as plaintext and should not be used for sensitive information! Here is a link to its
    <a href="https://github.com/MickHebert/passwordmanager" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Written quickly in Python to generate random stings of characters to be used as passwords.
    Is able to save them in plaintext along with what website they were made for.
    This is by no means a safe program and I mainly made it to mess around in Python and Git. However, I plan to add some
    functionality to it that will make it more useful and secure.
    </p>
    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <dl>
        <dd>Add encryption</dd>
        <dd>JSON support for web storage of encrypted passwords</dd>

    <!-- WEBSITE -->
    <h2>This Website</h2>
    <p>
        A chance to study HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web design. Includes a database for STL storage project.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted to build a website for myself so that I could display a knowledge of
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>,
        and JavaScript to employers and friends. This website is the culmination of my skills in those subjects up to this point,
        and I update it almost daily through its
        <a href="https://github.com/MickHebert/MickHebert.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub repository.</a>
        In this repo, I have a dev branch which I push to regularly, and at the end of the week merge it with main after
        checking for errors that may show up in deployment.
    </p>
    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <p>
        Here are some things I would like to add currently to the site:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dd>Resize all images and save WEBP format so that they are properly scaled and take up less storage</dd>
        <dd>Add a heading image and banner across the top of each page.
        <dl>
            <dd>While one already exists, it is very low quality and not up to my standards (or any standards)</dd>
            <dd>Make it 3-dimensional with blocks that slide out/glow as the user hovers over them</dd>
        </dl>
        </dd>
        <dd>Add scripting to home page for added secret functionality</dd>
        <dd>Fix navigation bar (covering top of header words) - make it not use ul and li</dd>
    </dl>

    <!-- STL STORAGE DATABASE -->
    <h2>STL Storage Database</h2>
    <p>
        A currently untitled project that is more of an idea at the moment.
        Will store and display STL files I have made that a user can download much like other common websites such as
        Printables or Thingiverse.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project combines my love for 3D printing with web design so that I can have fun
        while learning about databased and web storage.
    </p>
<hr />
    <!-- Game AI Project -->
    <h2>Game AI</h2>
    <p>
        Directly inspired by a friend of mine, I have decided to make a project that will incorporate a simple game AI.
        This AI will be able to determine which moves to make in a certain situation in a Pac-Man like game.
        This project should be a good test on algorithmic complexity as well as optimization. I plan to convert it into
        JavaScript so that it will be playable on this website IF POSSIBLE. Stay tuned for more updates!
    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <p>
        Here are some things I would like to add currently to the site:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dd>Begin work on node-based map system</dd>
        <dd>Implement GUI</dd>
        <dd>Implement player control</dd>
        After all of this:
        <dd>Implement enemy AI system (breadth first search algorithm)</dd>
