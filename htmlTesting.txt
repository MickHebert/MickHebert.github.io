This is a simple document with examples of things to use in HTML

Void elements - void elements are things such as <img> this element has no ending (</img>):
    do not have a closing tag
    have attributes

Attributes:
    attributes contain info about elements
    go inside the element
    for example: <p class="editor-note">
        or 
    <a>
    This element takes attributes and will make a link out of the text that it is before. For example:
        <p> <a href="https://github.com" "title=Github" target="_blank" /> Link here </p> - This would make "Link here" link to the GitHub home page
            - href is the reference page or the page you will be sent to
            - title is the tooltip that will pop up when you hover over the link
            - target is where the tab will open, put "_blank" for a new tab leave blank for no tab
        <a> can be attached to text, images, or anything on the page
        <a> can also be used to link to specific spots on pages using tags
            - set a tag using id="" in the formatting call (<p id="">) and call this id in <a> with # (<a href=link#position)


Boolean attributes:
    attributes that are written without values
    for example: disabled
    This attribute will disable, obviously, whatever it is in such as an input:
        <input type="text" disabled="disabled" /> - this will disable the user's input into this text box
        Could also be written shorthand like
        <input type="text" disabled /> for disabled text box
        and
        <input type="text" /> for enabled text box

Just learned this one on my own!
<span>
    This is an inline container that can be used to markup part of a text
    For example:
    <h1> Title <span title="hello world:> Page </span> is here! </h1> would add a fun little note onto the word "Page" or whatever the container spans around

HTML anatomy:
    All HTML documents must begin with <!DOCTYPE html> this is a historical thing that is required just to get it to work lol
    Right under this is <html> and at the end of the document should be </html> (at least for now)
        This is just a wrapper for every element on the page, to keep it all neat and organized and that you know what is in the display space
        Contains the language, for me, it would of course be <html lang="en-US"> html here </html>
    Under this is the <head> element. This will contain metadata such as the character set of the page and the title of the tab WILL NOT be displayed
        <meta charset="utf-8" /> should always be put here just to make sure it can handle everything, it's good practice!
        <tile></title> is the inline element that sets the tab's name
    After the <head> is, you guessed it! The <body>! This is all body text that WILL be displayed
        Here will be everything that is included above and more

Look at index.html for a full (basic) webpage


To display special characters in HTML (<, >, ", ', and &) you must encode them:
    < = &lt;
    > = &gt;
    " = &quot;
    ' = &apos;
    & = &amp;
    These are pretty easy to remember, just make sure that if you want to use a conjunction, use &apos;!

Comments:
    Comments in HTML go something like this;
        <!-- I am a comment -->
    This is just an easy way to leave some hint of the functionality in your websites

Images:
    <img src="image" other modifiers here />
    You can resize images with the height and width modifiers
    Add alt text with alt
    Add tooltips with title
        It is preferred to resize in an image editor and save to WEBP
    Instead of linking to pages with <a> you can link to an image or anything else in the website's directory

Website Design
    Header
        - Where name of website goes, maybe put my name there
    Nav Bar
        - Website navigation
    Main Content
        - Center of screen,
    Sidebar
        - Related info/links, contextual, doesn't have to be there
    Footer
        - strip on bottom of page, fine print,

Nav Bar
    All CSS scripting
    Hover is used to get it to change color
